### Niche AI Integration Features for a To-Do App

1. **Smart Task Suggestions**

    - Use AI to analyze the user's past tasks and suggest new tasks or subtasks based on their habits and patterns. For example, if a user often schedules meetings on Mondays, the app can suggest adding a "Team Meeting" task on the following Monday.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Task Entry**

    - Allow users to add tasks using natural language. For example, "Meeting with John tomorrow at 10 AM" will be automatically parsed and added to the task list with the correct title, time, and date.

3. **Priority Prediction**

    - Implement a machine learning model to predict the priority of tasks based on their content and user history. The app can suggest priority levels (High, Medium, Low) when a new task is created.

4. **Context-Aware Reminders**

    - Use AI to determine the best time to send reminders based on the user's daily routine and behavior patterns. For instance, if a user usually checks tasks in the morning, the app can prioritize sending reminders at that time.

5. **Automated Task Categorization**

    - Utilize machine learning to automatically categorize tasks into predefined categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping) based on keywords and user history.

6. **Sentiment Analysis for Task Notes**

    - Perform sentiment analysis on task descriptions and notes to gauge the user's mood or stress level. The app can then provide motivational messages or suggest relaxation techniques if negative sentiment is detected.

7. **AI-Powered Productivity Insights**

    - Provide insights and analytics on user productivity. For example, the app can analyze how long tasks typically take, peak productivity times, and suggest ways to optimize task management.

8. **Voice Assistant Integration**

    - Integrate with popular voice assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa) to allow users to add, update, or complete tasks using voice commands.

9. **Personalized Task Difficulty Estimation**

    - Use AI to estimate the difficulty level of tasks based on user feedback and historical data. This helps users allocate the appropriate amount of time and resources to each task.

10. **Dynamic Scheduling**
    - Implement AI to dynamically adjust the user's schedule based on real-time changes and priorities. For example, if a high-priority task is added, the AI can reschedule lower-priority tasks accordingly.

<!-- Integrating these AI-driven features can significantly enhance the user experience, making the To-Do app not only more efficient but also more intuitive and personalized. -->
